# Your first step to FAIR

This directory contains the materials for a 45-minute workshop that gives a brief overview of the FAIR principles, including the easiest way to make
a simple dataset FAIR.

This workshop was originally developed for Open Access Week 2020 by Matthias Liffers at the [Australian Research Data Commons](https://www.ardc.edu.au/).
